\section{What do we want to achieve?}

We want Alice to be able to store her passwords.
We want her to store identifier and password pairs in a database, e.g.\ the 
credit card identifier and its PIN-code or a username and its password.
Then Alice can later retrieve the password when needed, without risk of 
forgetting it.
Without diving into the details, we secure this database by encrypting all 
entries under a master password.

We will first cover the adversary's capabilities (\cref{AdversaryModel}) and 
with the adversary in mind state our required properties 
(\cref{RequiredProperties}).
Then we will outline our design and prove it secure (\cref{Design}).

\subsection{Who is our adversary?}
\label{AdversaryModel}

Our adversary, Eve, wants to learn Alice's stored passwords.
We assume that Eve has online access to the encrypted database of identifier 
and password pairs.
She can also force Alice to provide her with a master password.
More formally, Eve has access to the ciphertext, she can observe updates to the
ciphertext and she can request decryption keys.

We will give two examples of how Eve practically can achieve these 
capabilities.
First, she can be an authority who has Alice's phone in possession and can 
compel Alice to give up her master password.
Second, Eve could trick Alice to install a malicious app that can access the 
database in secondary storage.
This means that Eve also has online access to the database, or she has at least
the possibility to access it at several points in time to detect changes.

\subsection{What properties do we want?}
\label{RequiredProperties}

\subsubsection{Confidentiality}

Eve wants to learn as much as possible about Alice's passwords.
We have already suggested that we need confidentiality by stating that the 
password database is encrypted.

What level of confidentiality to we need, \ac{IND-CCA}?

\subsubsection{Deniability}

We want Alice to be able to give Eve a wrong master password while Eve has no 
way of verifying that the master password is wrong.

We want the passwords to maintain their lengths, or more generally, we want the 
passwords to maintain their password policy.

\subsubsection{Verifiability and integrity}

Alice should be able to verify that the master password is correct without 
preventing deniability, i.e.\ leaking any information about the correctness of 
the master password.
She wants this feature to detect if she entered the master password wrongly.
